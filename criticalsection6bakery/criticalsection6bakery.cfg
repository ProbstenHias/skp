\* Artificial limit to the token number.
\* Without this limit, token numbers might grow infinitely,
\* which makes it impossible to model-check the algorithm due to
\* an infinite number of different states. However, this change 
\* will make the algorithm non starvation-free (as can be shown
\* through model checking).
