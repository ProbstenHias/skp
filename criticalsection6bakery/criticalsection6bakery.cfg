\* Add statements after this line.

\* The number of concurrent processes trying to enter the critical section
N = 2

\* Artificial limit to the token number.
\* Without this limit, token numbers might grow infinitely,
\* which makes it impossible to model-check the algorithm due to
\* an infinite number of different states. However, this change 
\* will make the algorithm non starvation-free (as can be shown
\* through model checking). 
MaxTokenNumber = 4

\* The Bakery Algorithm guarantees mutual exclusion.
PROPERTY MutualExclusion

\* The Bakery Algorithm guarantees freedom from deadlocks.
PROPERTY NoDeadlock

\* Theoretically, the Bakery Algorithm guarantees freedom from starvation.
\* However, for this it requires an infinite number of states, making
\* it impossible to model-check the algorithm completely. Our change to 
\* artificially limit the maximum token number violates the property of
\* starvation freedom.
PROPERTY NoStarvation
